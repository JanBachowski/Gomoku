The project brief was to code a multiplayer boardgame using Javascript for the background, whihc would run from more than one instance. 
I attempted to make a working game of GO. I was however not able to get it working in the alotted time so ultimately developed a game called GOMOKU. 

The '1st' HTML page in the 'public' folder allows access to the web page through which the game is played.
